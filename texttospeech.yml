          text: "Create a script for a podcast targeted at young children using Azure's\
            \ Text-To-Speech (TTS) service. The writing style should be playful, warm,\
            \ and engaging, similar to a dialogue between friendly characters. Use\
            \ the specified XML format so that different \"voices\" can be assigned\
            \ to the two characters in the podcast.\n\n# Instructions\n\n- Maintain\
            \ a cheerful, conversational tone, avoiding complex words. Assume young\
            \ children as your target audience.\n- The script should use an alternating\
            \ voice format between at least two characters. Be sure to guide children\
            \ into learning while maintaining a playful and curious attitude.\n- Each\
            \ part of the dialogue must be enclosed in `<voice></voice>` tags, clearly\
            \ identifying the speaker.\n- Consider using two 'voices' provided by\
            \ Azure TTS, such as \"en-US-JennyNeural\" and \"en-US-AriaNeural.\"\n\
            \  - Jenny is the primary narrator, while Aria asks questions and expresses\
            \ excitement.\n- Use the `<speak>` XML tag as the root element and ensure\
            \ itâ€™s well-formatted for TTS use.\n- Explore fun topics like science,\
            \ nature, mathematics, or daily habits in a sequence that makes learning\
            \ fun.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Topic Introduction**: Introduce the new topic\
            \ in a friendly and engaging way.\n2. **Dialogue Sequence**: Alternate\
            \ between characters:\n    - The main character (Jenny) introduces information.\n\
            \    - The secondary character (Aria) reacts, asks simple questions, or\
            \ expresses curiosity.\n3. **Wrap-Up & Encouragement**: End with a positive\
            \ summary or encouraging note for children.\n\n# Output Format\n\n- Use\
            \ SSML format with the `<speak>` and `<voice>` tags.\n- Include alternate\
            \ dialogue sections with at least two characters.\n- Write complete and\
            \ well-formed XML.\n\n## Example\n\n<speak version=\"1.0\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis\"\
            \ xml:lang=\"en-US\">\n\n<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">\n    Hello,\
            \ my little friends! Today, we are going on an adventure to learn all\
            \ about one of the most magical creatures of the sea: the dolphin!\n</voice>\n\
            \n<voice name=\"en-US-AriaNeural\">\n    Oooh, dolphins! I always wanted\
            \ to learn about dolphins! Do they really love to jump out of the water?\n\
            </voice>\n\n<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">\n    That's right, Aria!\
            \ Dolphins love to leap out of the water. It helps them move faster and\
            \ also looks like theyâ€™re having so much fun! Theyâ€™re super strong swimmersâ€”just\
            \ like you when you try your best in the pool!\n</voice>\n\n<voice name=\"\
            en-US-AriaNeural\">\n    Wow, that's so cool! How do dolphins talk to\
            \ each other?\n</voice>\n\n<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">\n    Great\
            \ question, Aria! Dolphins talk to each other using sounds like clicks,\
            \ whistles, and even special calls. It's almost like they have their own\
            \ secret language!\n</voice>\n\n<voice name=\"en-US-AriaNeural\">\n  \
            \  Dolphins are so amazing! I want to learn their secret language too!\n\
            </voice>\n\n<voice name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">\n    Maybe one day! For\
            \ now, it's just fun to know that every dolphin family has its very own\
            \ way of communicating, just like we do with our families. Isnâ€™t that\
            \ amazing?\n</voice>\n\n<voice name=\"en-US-AriaNeural\">\n    Yes, it\
            \ is! I love learning new things with you, Jenny.\n</voice>\n\n<voice\
            \ name=\"en-US-JennyNeural\">\n    And I love sharing it with you, Aria!\
            \ And remember, friends, keep being curious and asking questions. There's\
            \ so much out there to discover!\n</voice>\n\n</speak>\n\n# Notes\n\n\
            - Be sure to alternate voices for an engaging back-and-forth dialogue.\n\
            - Maintain an overall length for each script that would produce a 2-3\
            \ minute long audio.\n- You may add other relevant voices if needed to\
            \ enhance the storytelling, but always ensure they are in service to the\
            \ topicâ€™s narrative.\n- The SSML structure should be correctly formed,\
            \ as invalid XML will lead to errors during the TTS generation."

            \ description, emphasizing that the illustration should be cute, whimsical,\
            \ and child-friendly.\n\nKeep the following in mind:\n\n- Imagery should\
            \ be soft, approachable, and appropriate for children.\n- Include specific\
            \ visual elements, colors, characters, and settings that evoke warmth\
            \ and friendliness.\n- Refrain from anything that could appear frightening\
            \ or overly complex.\n\n# Steps \n\n1. Summarize the main components of\
            \ the image to include key subjects, actions, and themes.\n2. Use gentle,\
            \ friendly language that specifies 'cute' elements, such as \"cuddly animals,\"\
            \ \"smiling children,\" or \"soft pastel colors.\" \n3. Add a setting\
            \ that feels wholesome or magical, such as a \"grassy meadow,\" \"storybook\
            \ village,\" or \"fanciful cloud world.\"\n4. Include friendly character\
            \ descriptions, specifying expressions and playful features.\n5. Adjust\
            \ sensory details to evoke softness or gentleness (e.g., \"fluffy,\" \"\
            cozy,\" \"playful environment\").\n\n# Output Format\n\n\"Create an illustration\
            \ of [main subject doing specific action] in a [setting description].\
            \ The illustration should be cute and child-friendly, with [light colors\
            \ or specific tones]. The characters should be [appearance descriptors],\
            \ and the scene should evoke feelings of [joy, warmth, safety, etc.].\"\
            \n\n# Examples\n\n**User Input**: \"A dragon in the forest\"\n\n**DALLE\
            \ Prompt**: \"Create an illustration of a small, friendly dragon taking\
            \ a nap in a sunlit forest clearing. The scene should be cute and child-friendly,\
            \ with soft green colors, dappled sunlight, and playful animals like squirrels\
            \ and birds nearby. The dragon should look cuddly, with round features\
            \ and a gentle expression, evoking a sense of warmth and calm.\"\n\n**User\
            \ Input**: \"A princess with a cat\"\n\n**DALLE Prompt**: \"Create an\
            \ illustration of a young princess sitting in a lovely garden, petting\
            \ a smiling cat. The scene should be whimsical and child-friendly, with\
            \ bright, cheerful colors like pinks, yellows, and greens. The princess\
            \ should have a friendly expression, while the cat should look fluffy\
            \ and comfortable, creating a sense of happiness and playfulness.\" \n\
            \n**User Input**: \"Space adventure\"\n\n**DALLE Prompt**: \"Create an\
            \ illustration of a young astronaut floating in space next to a friendly\
            \ alien. They should both be smiling and waving towards each other. The\
            \ scene should be cute and child-friendly, with bright stars and gentle\
            \ pastel colors, and the spaceship in the background should be playful,\
            \ resembling something from a child's dream.\"\n\n# Notes\n\n- The goal\
            \ of the prompt is to ensure the AI generates images that are suitable\
            \ for young children, avoiding sharp details, negative emotions, or anything\
            \ that might be scary or unsettling.\n- Focus on positive, nurturing interactions\
            \ between characters.\n- Colors should generally be bright, pastel, or\
            \ soft, reinforcing a child-friendly tone."
